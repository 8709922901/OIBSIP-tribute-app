                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an
                    Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to
                    2007. He
                    was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
                    spent
                    the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                    involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
                    came
                    to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and
                    launch
                    vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role
                    in
                    India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in
                    1974.
                </p><br>

                <p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
                    Bharatiya
                    Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
                    President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a
                    single
                    term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                    civilian honour.</p><br>

                <p>While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died
                    from
                    an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level
                    dignitaries,
                    attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full
                    state
                    honours.</p><br>

                <h2>Early life and education</h2> <br>

                <p> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                    pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State
                    of
                    Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his
                    mother
                    Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and
                    forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four
                    brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and
                    landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group
                    found
                    in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family
                    business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri
                    Lanka,
                    as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge
                    to
                    the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost
                    by
                    the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was
                    born. As
                    a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.</p><br>

                <p>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student
                    who
                    had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics. After
                    completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to
                    attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from
                    where he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in
                    Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was
                    dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project
                    was
                    finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to
                    him,
                    "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline." He narrowly missed
                    achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight
                    positions were available in the IAF.</p><br>

                <h2>Career as a scientist</h2><br>
                <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                    Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
                    Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
                    Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
                    unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram
                    Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S.
                    Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was
                    transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of
                    India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in
                    near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
                    independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the
                    programme to include more engineers</p>
                <br>

                <p>Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential
                    election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His
                    term
                    lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007 and died On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to
                    deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management
                    Shillong.
                    While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the
                    auditorium
                    after a brief rest.[86] At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed
